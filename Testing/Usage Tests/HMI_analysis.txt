=== PROJECT COMPARISON ===

Project  Code Data BSS Flash RAM
-------  ---- ---- --- ----- ---
HMI     16524    0 536 16524 536
CONTROL  4704    0 540  4704 540




=== MEMORY UTILIZATION PER TM4C ===
HMI Flash: 16524 bytes (6.3% of 256KB)
HMI RAM:   536 bytes (1.64% of 32KB)

CONTROL Flash: 4704 bytes (1.79% of 256KB)
CONTROL RAM:   540 bytes (1.65% of 32KB)

=== SYSTEM TOTALS (Average per board) ===
Average Flash per TM4C: 10614 bytes
Average RAM per TM4C:   538 bytes

=== UART BUFFER ANALYSIS ===
From HMI.c:
  • Password buffers: ~18 bytes (pass[6], Confirmpass[6], new_pass[6])
  • Communication buffers: ~40 bytes (response[20], startup_check[20])
  • Total HMI UART: ~58 bytes

From CONTROL.c:
  • Password buffer: 20 bytes (master_password[20])
  • UART buffers: 70 bytes (rx_buffer[50], read_buffer[20])
  • Total CONTROL UART: ~90 bytes

Total UART buffers in system: ~148 bytes

=== PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT ===
Both projects are highly memory efficient
UART buffers are appropriately sized
Plenty of headroom for additional features
Well-suited for TM4C123GH6PM hardware

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
1. Both projects can run simultaneously without memory issues
2. UART buffer sizes are adequate for 5-digit password communication
3. Consider adding error counters or logging features
4. System has capacity for additional security features
